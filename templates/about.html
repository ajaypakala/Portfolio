    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Pakala Ajaybabu, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering, with a CGPA of 8.3 out of 10. I completed my Intermediate at Sri Chaitanya Junior College with 913 out of 1000 marks, and my schooling at Maitreya Vidya Mandir with 552 out of 600 marks.</p>
    <p>I have a deep interest in technology, programming, and innovation, particularly in areas where software and hardware combine to create practical solutions for real-world challenges. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained practical knowledge and technical experience in programming languages such as Python and C, along with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience using the Flask framework for backend development and developer tools such as Git, VS Code, and Visual Studio. Alongside my technical skills, I have developed qualities like problem-solving, teamwork, adaptability, and analytical thinking, which help me perform effectively in collaborative environments.</p>
    <p>During my studies, I have worked on multiple academic and personal projects that helped me apply my learning to real applications. One of my notable projects is the Rag-Picking Rover, an IoT-based system designed for remote waste collection using a Wi-Fi-controlled camera. This project helped me gain experience in robotics, IoT integration, real-time monitoring, and teamwork. Another major project I developed is Jarvis – an AI Voice Assistant using Python, which integrates features such as voice recognition, text-to-speech, wake-word detection, YouTube playback, joke-telling, time and date retrieval, and real-time question-and-answer functionality using APIs. Through this project, I improved my knowledge of Python programming, API integration, and conversational logic. I also developed a Plagiarism Checker using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, capable of analyzing and comparing text files to detect similarities. This project enhanced my understanding of natural language processing, feature extraction, and text similarity algorithms. In addition, I created a Random Quote Generator, a web-based application using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which displays motivational quotes dynamically. It helped me improve my understanding of front-end and back-end integration. I also designed and developed a Portfolio Website using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my academic projects, technical skills, and achievements. The website features a responsive layout, smooth navigation, and an appealing design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
    <p>In terms of professional experience, I have completed three internships — an Intelligent Automation Virtual Internship, an AWS AI-ML Virtual Internship, and an internship at AD Infocom Systems in the domain of Python Programming. These internships gave me the opportunity to work on real-time tasks, apply theoretical knowledge in practical situations, and enhance my problem-solving and teamwork abilities. I have also participated in Radian 2K24 Project Expo at ANITS College, Visakhapatnam, and Gamantra 2K24 Project Expo at KITS College, Kakinada, where I showcased my projects and received positive feedback from faculty and peers. These events helped me develop my presentation and communication skills while engaging with other innovators.</p>
    <p>Overall, I am a B.Tech final-year student passionate about software development, artificial intelligence, IoT, and web technologies. My short-term goal is to start my career in a reputed organization where I can apply my knowledge, gain hands-on experience, and contribute to meaningful projects. My long-term goal is to grow into a professional who contributes to innovative and impactful solutions in the field of software development or IoT systems.</p>
